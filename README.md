# Surveyform
In the survey form project, you will build a website for taking surveys using HTML form from scratch. All the elements of the form can be created using basic HTML.
# How are We going to Build the Survey Form?
Use the form element to create an HTML form for user input.
The form element contains different options name, email, age, etc. The different input elements have different tasks assigned to them like
name for taking name input
email for taking email input
text-area for taking a large message
radio buttons to select one of the multiple options
checkbox to select zero or more values for submission.
The form includes the following buttons:
reset button to reset form to initial values
submit button to submit the form data to a form handler.
